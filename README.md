# Welcome to TaskMaster ðŸ“‹

TaskMaster is an Expo project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It is a simple to-do list app built with React Native, Expo, and Redux. This app helps you stay organized and focused by allowing you to create, manage, and complete tasks effortlessly.

## Get Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the App**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).



## Features
